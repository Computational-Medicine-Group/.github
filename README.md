## About Us

We are  the **Computational Medicine Group** at the Inselspital Bern, under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Alexander Leichtle**. Our research focuses on leveraging **machine learning** and **big data** to improve clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine.

**Computational Medicine** is a new field of medicine at the interface between data generating (mainly diagnostic) medical disciplines (e.g. "-omics")  and data science (informatics, statistics). It provides information on patients, their health and underlying processes and pathways by exhaustive computational and statistical methodology, that exceed the capacities of conventional approaches.

Computational medicine tries to generate and assess models from existing data to predict/classify/diagnose new patients. It uses large-scale standard modeling approaches (GLMs, GEEs &c.), but also "deep" machine learning and digitally resembles complex decision-finding processes that today depend on physician's experience, knowledge, and intuition.

Our group works on exciting projects such as **Swiss BioRef**, which aims to create personalized reference ranges for laboratory medicine using automated tools. We also engage in **PGXLink**, a project linking pharmacogenomic data to drug metabolism, enhancing personalized treatment options.

We specialize in applying **Bayesian models** and **AI-driven approaches** to analyze clinical and metabolomic data, contributing to better predictions of disease outcomes, especially in fields like cardiovascular health and organ transplantation.

### Funding

Our group is funded by the Swiss Personal Health Network as well as the Swiss National Science Foundation  and the Bern Center of Precision Medicine.
